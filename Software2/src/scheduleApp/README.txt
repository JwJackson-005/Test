Directions: Open the project, log in with either the test account (username: test password:test) or the admin account (username: admin passoword: admin). Proceed to the customers menu to add, remove, or update customers. Use the appointments menu to schedule or cancel appointments. Use the reports menu to view three pre-defined reports on appointments. Use the logout button when finished or if you wish to change users.

Third Report Description: The third report that I created will allow the user to select between two dates: a start date and an end date. The start date defaults to the earliest date of any appointment, while the end date defaults to the date of the latest scheduled appointment. The report will show all appointments that fall between the two dates, and the user can change both the start and end dates so long as the start date is before or equal to the end date.
